Few things I want to mention are: 
1)I changed the file layout to make my code work(index.css no longer in use)
2)I tried for hours to make my images more high quality, they're readable and understandle hope that's enough. While using some drawing/visual tools i tend to lose a lot of resolution
3)Bootstrap was heavily used in my project for aesthetics. I have followed a very barron template and and would call this project something I hard coded

Lastly, I did not work with anyone nor I have the self-plaigrism(as if I had anything to self plaigrise from)
I really hope you like my work
