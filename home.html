It was interesting to see because among different cars from various price ranges the problems people
                    had with the UI are quite common. All subjects picked for the interview drive cars that still allow them to manually adjust settings like climate control and seat warmers. For the sake of simplicity we will ignore existing Car UI’s
                    that have gotten rid of buttons altogether. The subject of this assignment will be infotainment screens that have touch screens, sync with phones, and allow you to view car data and non-essential car settings.</p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-xl js-scroll-trigger"

No one I observed was unexpectedly confused- which I expected since the infotainment interfaces they were using were all heavily inspired by phone UI’s.
    <br></br>
<b>Experience:</b> I was interviewing people with a variety of cars and a very large price range. All cars were relatively new(above 2015). All of them had a very similar UI and combining their common outlines would give the design above. Again, since their phones were so intuitive they weren’t that confused with the car UI. However, they were tapping on the screen to be able to do what they wanted more than 3-4 times usually for simply changing songs or opening maps on the car UI. The drivers pulled out their phones, which is dangerous and illegal, to do most of the operations. They never used the car UI unless they were in a situation where they needed to be careful on the road, since it was easier to glance back and for the car screen and the road, nevertheless stressful and required a lot of concentration to the point where all 3 drivers turned off the music and stopped conversing with me.
<br></br>
<b>Motives:</b> Nobody had any other motivation with the infotainment screen other than pull up directions and play music. They all had specific playlists they liked to play on the road. They all made it so that if they didn’t feel like listening to a song they could shuffle to the next one and not have to look up songs. None of the interviewees mentioned they used most of the functionality. Less experienced drivers tended to be not aware of everything you can do on the UX.
<br></br>
<b>Challenges:</b> Among all the drivers Zeki was the one who put in the most thought, as he mentioned he felt anxiety from using his phone from driving. He noticeably slowed down if he was using his phone or the UI. Elif didn’t necessarily slow down or show noticeable symptoms, but said she was less safe using her phone. Marc, as the most experienced driver, trusted his reflexes to operate the UI and phone. For the sake of the interview they all used the car screen at least once for maps and music, but all of them mentioned they wouldn’t have otherwise. They can’t just use the screen without looking while I have observed in other situations they can type on their phones and do common actions like go to Spotify and pause without looking.</p>

Mostly inspired by Marc and hints of Zeki, Michael has driven at least half an hour every morning since he got his driver’s license. He has never lived close to a job or school, but he doesn’t feel very rushed and has accepted driving at least an hour a day as a part of his routine.
    <br></br>

It’s essential that the user interface allows him to pause or go to the next song without much effort. He wants to find the infotainment screen where he left it when he comes back(not rebooted) and doesn’t want anything about the car taking away from ease of driving. Michael’s audio content is crucial, but his car won’t continue playing music from the right app on his phone. He doesn’t like doing that all the time, and generally feels switching between apps on a car screen is unnecessary.

<br></br>
Michael is the persona most likely to come across in America as the average American spends more than four and a half hours on the road a week just commuting(U.S. Census Bureau data). If Michael feels the need to look at his phone to do something he can do on the car screen, it represents a bigger problem of screens not having the utility nor the convenience of a phone. This is the persona that shouldn’t have a problem with the learning curve on any car. Michael likes comfort and monotonicity, and if he doesn’t want to interact with a car it means it’s not practical enough for most Americans.</p>

Annie is Elif and Zeki's inexperienced and less confident sides in driving. Annie walked to school her whole life, and continued her life in a walking city, doesn’t need her car for anything other than for carrying heavy items and joyriding. She knows the public transportation systems like the inside of her palm, and she doesn’t see herself driving regularly until walking becomes too hard.
    <br></br>

Annie usually has problems on how to connect her phone so that she can answer calls, play music, or start navigation. Also, she tends to be a reckless driver since she actually has to search for what she’s looking for and it takes way longer than 5 seconds, limit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has put for looking away from the road going 70mph.

<br></br>
Annie is the archetype of the casual driver. She doesn’t know the streets enough to not use navigation. Whether it’s kids that just got their license and driving their moms car, New Yorkers who barely touch their cars, or older generations who won’t take much time getting to know the car tech- Annie’s effort in learning the car and her interactions will represent a broad number of people. For Annie driving is an occasion. She wants to enjoy her drives, and the car’s hassle should be negligible compared to its utility and pleasure. Annie won’t bother to explore what she can manage on the infotainment screen unless she’s really bored. Annie has to be able to spot how she can play her music and how to go somewhere as soon as she gets in the car. Her reflexes aren’t as developed as experienced drivers so she should be able to press her music or maps without taking her eyes off the road. Not everyone drives frequently, and Annie reflects what the group of people who have access to cars but barely drive need.</div>
